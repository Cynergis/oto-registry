  Define a new report type with a report analyst, in the report knowledge base: capture what the
  report is, what identifies a document, where its data comes from, when it runs, where documents
  go and what a run must achieve; draft its sections and fields from the sample PDF; map each field
  to a column; and repeat until the report ontology's own gates find nothing blocking. Use when the
  user wants to "define a new report", "onboard a report", "start a new report type", "capture the
  requirements of a report", or hands over a sample PDF to turn into a report type.

# Define a new report type with the analyst

You are working with a report analyst. They know the report, its readers and the table its data
comes from; they are not expected to know the ontology. At the end of this skill the report type
exists **as facts in the project's knowledge base**, through the curate gates, with its lifecycle
at `inception` or `saved`, and the catalogue answers the report ontology's questions about it.
The template is then built from the sample PDF with the `pdf-to-template` skill, and the flow runs
it.

## The ontology decides what to ask

Do not work from a remembered checklist. The project's `capture.json` (`oto ontology capture
--project <root>`) is the form: **sections** are the report ontology's questions grouped by who
asks them (the analyst, the data team, operations, compliance, the engineer), each naming the item
types it needs; **types** are the classes with their fields (typed, enums as choices, `required`)
and links (with their targets and cardinality), every one carrying its term. Read it before the
first question; regenerate it when the vocabulary changes. What a question asks for and who can
answer it are in `capture.json`, not in this file.

When you do not understand an item, `kg_define <term>` (or `oto query define <term>`) gives its
definition; ask the analyst in their words, not the ontology's.

## Before the first question

1. `kg_ask Q1` (which report types exist) and `kg_ask Q20` (which fields the catalogue already
   defines, with their ids and meanings). You need both: to avoid a duplicate report, to borrow
   defaults from a similar one, and to reuse field ids.
2. Ask for the sample PDF and the analyst's name. Agree a report id (lower case, hyphens): it is the
   `scope` of every capture of this report, so its items never collide with another report's.
3. Inspect the PDF yourself (the `pdf-to-template` plugin's `inspect_pdf.py`, when installed, writes
   page images and text spans; otherwise read it). If a page is raster, say now that fidelity will be
   capped and ask whether a production PDF exists.
4. Record the report as started: the first capture holds the `ReportType` (its `reportId`,
   `purpose`, `lifecycleStatus: inception`, audience, cadence, locales) and its first `StatusChange`
   (`inception`, by the analyst, today). From this moment the report is visible as started.

## The interview

Ask in small groups, a few related items at a time, in the order `capture.json` lists the sections;
offer a similar report's value as the default ("the balanced fund profile runs on the third
business day; the same here?"). The report ontology asks, in this order:

1. **What the report is** (the analyst, Q1, Q17): title, kind, purpose, audience, owner, locales,
   layout.
2. **What identifies a document** (operations, Q2): the parameters (fund, series, as-of, language)
   and where each one's allowed values come from at run time (`UniverseQuery`).
3. **Where the data comes from** (the data team, Q5, Q4): the data source and the one table that
   holds every column of this report; which column carries each parameter.
4. **How it runs and where documents go** (operations, Q11, Q10, Q12): the schedule (cadence, day,
   as-of rule, calendar, timezone), the publish policy (formats, path, retention), the
   observability policy (delivery deadline, tolerated failure rate, who is alerted, the run log).
5. **Rules, verification and approval** (compliance, Q18, Q19): the rules on fields, which are
   regulatory; the verification thresholds and the approval policy.

If the analyst does not know an answer, do not guess and do not block the session: leave the item
out and go on; the gate carries it as an open question, with who can answer it if they told you.

## What you draft yourself

From the sample PDF, draft the `Section`s and `Field`s (Q7, Q3):

- One section per visual box, with its purpose and its order; the macro that renders it when the
  template exists.
- One field per piece of information shown. The field id is the snake_case form of the English
  label (`total_fund_assets`). **Before naming a field, look it up in Q20's list**: if another report
  already shows the same information, use its id, type and meaning, so the two reports are
  recognised as sharing it. Invent a new id only for information the catalogue does not have.
- A `FieldMeaning` per language the report is offered in: the label the report prints and what the
  value is, precisely enough that someone could check a number against it.
- A list or table is a field with a list type and the structure of one row.

Show the analyst the sections and fields as a table and correct what they change. Their approval
of this table is the point of the session: take the time to get it right.

## The data mapping

Every field is supplied by one column of the report's table (`sourcedFrom`, Q4). Propose a column
per field (`lineageStatus: proposed`); if the analyst pastes the table's columns, match the real
names. Set `verified` only for what they confirm; leave `unmapped` what nobody can place yet. Tell
the analyst that a structured field (a list, a series) reads JSON text from its column, an array of
rows in the field's row shape, and show the expected JSON for one such field.

## The loop: every confirmed group goes through the gates

Write the confirmed items as a capture file against `capture.json` — `{"doc": "<report id>-interview",
"as_of": "<today>", "scope": "<report id>", "items": [{"type": "Field", "id": "mer", "label": "MER", "fields":
{...}, "links": {"inReport": ["RT"], "sourcedFrom": ["COL-MER"]}, "where": "p.1", "quote": "..."}]}` — then:

```bash
oto curate propose --project <root> --from captures/<report id>-<group>.json   # refused if not a capture against the form
oto curate add --project <root> --from proposals/<doc>.json --dry-run
oto curate add --project <root> --from proposals/<doc>.json
oto curate check --project <root>
```

Read the check in the engine's words:

- **blocking** — a shape or a policy of the report ontology: a mapping that claims a column the
  table does not hold, a column outside the report's table, a changed fact with no supersession,
  a report type past inception with no section. Fix the capture and re-propose; never force.
- **gap** — a question the graph cannot answer yet (`question Q4 unanswered: … 12 fields have no
  column`), a field with no French meaning, a report that names no owner. Tell the analyst; it
  does not block.

`oto curate apply --by "<the analyst>" --note "<what the group made answerable>"` closes the
candidate; `oto build` makes it queryable. Then `oto query questions` (or `kg_questions`) says
which of the report's questions the graph now answers and which are open: report it as "the
catalogue answers N of M about this report; open: …".

## The report's status

`lifecycleStatus` lives on the report type and in its `StatusChange` history, appended, never
rewritten; the last one is the current status (Q17). Record a status when it is reached, only the
next one:

| Status | Recorded when |
|---|---|
| `inception` | by you, in the first capture, `changedBy` the analyst |
| `saved` | by you, when `oto curate check` finds nothing blocking after the sections, fields and mapping are approved and the schedule and policies are captured |
| `in_validation`, `in_production` | not in this skill: by whoever sends the template to validation, by whoever deploys |

If the session ends before `saved`, the report stays at `inception`, which is the truth.

## Finishing

Tell the analyst, in this order: that the report is defined, its status and its id; what is still
owed before production, from the last check's gaps and `kg_ask Q4` (fields with no column), `Q3`
(meanings missing in a language), `Q22`/`RP10` when the product pack is composed (what blocks
production readiness), with who can supply each; and that the next step is the template from the
sample PDF (`pdf-to-template`) and the flow that builds and runs it (`flow` pack, `kg_brief`).
If `Q20` now shows another report sharing many fields with this one, say so.

Do not edit the facts of other reports, the vocabulary, or anything outside this report's scope.
